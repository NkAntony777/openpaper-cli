PAPER_NOTES = {
    "paper_01_rag_lewis2020.md": """# Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks (Lewis et al., 2020) — {cite_001}

## Summary
RAG couples a query encoder + Wikipedia dense index (DPR) with a BART generator. Two variants: RAG-Sequence (same document for the whole answer) and RAG-Token (different documents per token). The retriever is trained with the QA supervision signal through the generator.

## Key findings
- Large gains over parametric-only T5/BART and over extractive DPR+reader pipelines on Natural Questions, TriviaQA, WebQuestions.
- Answers can be updated by swapping the index without retraining — crucial for fresh domains.
- Generation remains fluent even when retrieval fails (the model falls back on parametric knowledge).

## Relevance to our topic
The foundational architecture every domain QA system derives from; its parametric/non-parametric split is the baseline design choice.
""",
    "paper_02_dpr_karpukhin2020.md": """# Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain QA (Karpukhin et al., 2020) — {cite_002}

## Summary
Dual-encoder BERT retriever trained with in-batch negatives + QA pairs. At query time, encodes the question, retrieves top-k Wikipedia passages from an MIPS index.

## Key findings
- +9-19 absolute points over BM25 on Natural Questions open-domain retrieval.
- Retriever quality dominates end QA performance; generator can't compensate for missed evidence.
- Training data scale matters more than architecture tweaks.

## Relevance
Established dense retrieval as the default; BM25 ({cite_009}) remains the hard baseline on out-of-domain queries.
""",
    "paper_03_selfrag_asai2023.md": """# Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2023) — {cite_006}

## Summary
Adds reflection tokens so one Llama-style model learns four decisions: retrieve or not, relevance grade, support grade, utility grade. Trained with critique-augmented synthetic data + gold QA supervision.

## Key findings
- Adaptive retrieval saves ~30% of retrieval calls with no accuracy loss on some tasks.
- Citation precision improves markedly — the model learns to prefer generations grounded in retrieved text.
- Outperforms standard RAG and ChatGPT-like closed-book models on factuality benchmarks.

## Relevance
Directly addresses when retrieval helps in domain QA: for well-known facts the parametric memory suffices, for niche domain facts retrieval is essential.
""",
    "paper_04_crag_yan2024.md": """# Corrective RAG (Yan et al., 2024) — {cite_007}

## Summary
Inserts a retrieval evaluator (small T5) that classifies retrieved docs as correct/ambiguous/incorrect; triggers corrective actions: decomposition, filtering, confidence-weighted fusion, or web fallback.

## Key findings
- Robustness on single-hop QA improves most when retrieval is noisy — exactly the domain QA regime where terminology mismatch between query and corpus is common.
- Plug-in design: evaluator attaches to any RAG pipeline.

## Relevance
Domain QA queries are short and jargon-heavy; retrieval quality fluctuates, making corrective mechanisms high-value.
""",
    "paper_05_iterretgen_shao2023.md": """# Iterative Retrieval-Generation Synergy (Shao et al., 2023) — {cite_011}

## Summary
ITER-RETGEN alternates: draft an answer with the current context, use the draft as a new query, retrieve again, regenerate. Fixed small number of iterations.

## Key findings
- Largest gains on multi-hop questions (HotpotQA-style) and on questions requiring paraphrase of domain terminology.
- Works with frozen retriever and frozen generator — no retraining.

## Relevance
Domain QA often needs iterative refinement because the user's first query doesn't match corpus vocabulary.
""",
    "paper_06_atlas_izacard2022.md": """# Atlas (Izacard et al., 2022) — {cite_005}

## Summary
11B retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder (T5 + Contriever-style index) pretrained with masked-language modeling over the index and fine-tuned per task.

## Key findings
- Strong few-shot: matches or beats GPT-3-style models at 1/10th the parameters on knowledge tasks.
- Scaling the index helps until a point; scaling the model helps more on reasoning-heavy tasks.

## Relevance
Evidence that retrieval augmentation reduces the model-size requirement for domain QA — a cost argument.

COMBINED_RESEARCH = """# Combined Research — {topic}

## Theme 1: The retrieval/generation split
RAG ({cite_001}) established the parametric/non-parametric decomposition; REALM ({cite_003}) pushed retrieval into pretraining; Atlas ({cite_005}) scaled both. Consensus: retrieval should be treated as a replaceable component, not baked into weights.

## Theme 2: Retriever quality is the bottleneck
DPR ({cite_002}) beat BM25 ({cite_009}) on in-domain benchmarks, but unsupervised Contriever ({cite_010}) and SBERT ({cite_008}) embeddings remain competitive when labeled pairs are scarce — common in domain QA. Missed evidence cannot be compensated by the generator ({cite_002}).

## Theme 3: Adaptive and corrective retrieval
Self-RAG ({cite_006}) learns when to retrieve; CRAG ({cite_007}) detects bad retrieval and corrects it; ITER-RETGEN ({cite_011}) interleaves drafting and retrieval. Domain QA benefits disproportionately because query/corpus terminology mismatch is frequent.

## Theme 4: Evaluation gap
Surveys ({cite_012}) note that most RAG evaluations use open-domain Wikipedia QA; domain-specific factuality, citation precision, and latency trade-offs are under-measured.

1. **Domain terminology mismatch**: few works measure how query-side jargon affects retrieval recall in specialized domains; CRAG-style correction is promising but evaluated mostly on Wikipedia.
2. **Citation precision vs. fluency**: Self-RAG improves citation precision, but user studies in professional domains are missing.
3. **Latency-cost trade-off**: adaptive retrieval saves calls ({cite_006}) but end-to-end system cost analyses for deployment settings are absent.
